## Description:

- It is a path finding solution for two dimensional grid. The algorithm is DFS. 
- On execution, user should provide input (see below) the grid elements, start and end points. 
- The application returns the valid path and a UI representing the same. 

## How to run:

- execute the main.py file
- Enter user inputs :
    - for number of rows: int
    - for number of columns: int
    -elements of rows: int (1s and 0s)
	    - where 1 represents obstacles/walls
    - for start and end co-ordinates: x,y 
        - 0 < x < rows 
        - 0 < y < columns)
